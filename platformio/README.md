# Breadwinner Jar

This is prototype code for a jar lid to monitor starter fermentation.

## Getting Started

This Arduino project (`feather_platform.ino`) is specifically tailored for the Adafruit Feather HUZZAH + Adalogger setup. It expects those two components and a prototype board. The Adalogger is on the bottom, then the HUZZAH, then the prototype board.

### Prerequisites

Aside from the libaries referenced at the top of the file, you'll need a button, a switch, and a NeoPixel.

Here are the pinouts:

#### Feeding Button: 2
#### Recording Switch: 16
#### Neopixel: 0

The other pins for (SDA and SCL, MISO, etc.) are the standard ones indicated by the HUZZAH pinout:
